# MSDA Projects and Assignments

Welcome to my repository for projects completed during a Master of Science in Data Analytics, Data Science (MSDA-DS) program. This repository showcases my work across various courses, where I utilize Python, SQL, Tableau and other data analytics tools to solve real-world problems.

## Introduction

I entered the Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) program in January 2025, with an undegraduate degree from Illinois State University in Physics. My prior experience consists of 8 years as a high school physics teacher. My goal is to finish my program by May 2026.

Throughout this program, I have built a strong foundation in data analysis, learning to use tools and techniques such as Python, SQL, data visualization, and machine learning. This repository showcases the projects I have completed during my journey, reflecting my growth and the skills I have acquired.

## Technologies Used

- Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
- SQL: For database management, querying, and data extraction.
- Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau: For data visualization.
- scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
- PostgreSQL: For relational database management.
- Jupyter Notebook: For documenting and sharing analysis.
- MongoDB: For NoSQL database management and handling unstructured data.
- pgAdmin: For managing PostgreSQL databases with a graphical interface.
